DEVELOPERS:

This was built using the step-by-step instructions at http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/

The version of python used was 3.11.0 and tcod was 13.8.1.


PLAYERS:

The player's character is represented by "@".

Move in direction you want to go/attack (arrow keys or hjkl).

Objects you find in the dungeon can be picked up with "g".

Inventory can be opened with "i".

With an open inventory, you can equip/unequip/use items by pressing the key related to that item (a,b,c).

Saving your progress happens automatically when you close the game (Esc).

In true old school fashion, save files are deleted upon character death.
